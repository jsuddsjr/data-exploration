# Data Exploration Overview

This repo is part of a series of two-week projects in which I incorporate new skills into my toolkit. However, I readily
confess that this project didn't get quite as much attention as the previous ones, in part due to a pressing need for
better sleep habits.

For this project, I am using data provided by Zillow in their free
[Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI)](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) dataset, which contains home prices in the US
(by zip code and home size) from January 2000 onwards.

Here are some questions that Iâ€™d like to answer:

* How does the raw data compare to seasonally adjusted figures?
* How did the pandemic affect home prices across the country?
* How might I visualize this data on a map over time?
* Where is the market the strongest and weakest currently?
* What factors could contribute to home prices fluctuations?
* Is it possible to predict a surge in home prices using this data?

{Provide a description of the data set that you are analyzing.  Include the link of where you obtained the data.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software to analyze the data.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and
answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

## Data Analysis Results

{List the questions and the answers you found by doing this analysis.}

## Development Environment

Unlike previous projects, the output of this repo is not running code. Rather, I am using tools designed for data
science, Python libraries and Jupyter Notebooks. Rather than focusing on a finished product, I am going to show how I
came to my conclusions through a series of steps.

* [Anaconda 3](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
* [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)

> To work with Python in Jupyter Notebooks, you must activate an Anaconda environment in VS Code. To select an
environment, use the **Python: Select Interpreter** command from the **Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)**. Once the
appropriate environment is activated, you can create and open a Jupyter Notebook, connect to a remote Jupyter server
for running code cells, and export a Jupyter Notebook as a Python file.

## Useful Websites

Here's a list of websites that I found helpful in this project.
